elementaryOS setup
==================

A setup script to install the softwares/tools/utilities which I use regularly.
Though the script itself can be used for any Ubuntu based distro but it is written keeping elementaryOS in mind.
So while trying on other distros do it with care.

Run the `install.sh` script which will install the packages.

Once after installing the packages go through the things mentioned in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to complete the setup.
The installation script installs the packages. But few packages needs configurations to make use of them.
For now this is done manually so we know what kind of configuration is needed and why.
