elementary-setup
================

A setup script to install the tools which I use on daily basis after installing elementary-os.

Run the install.sh script which will install the packages.

After running the script all the needed packages will be installed. But still it is not done yet.
Follow below instructions to complete the setup.

1. Run `sudo pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight` to enable silverlight from pipelight plugin
2. Run `chsh $USER -s $(which zsh)` to make 'zsh' as default shell
