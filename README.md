elementaryOS setup
==================

A script to install the softwares/tools/utilities needed on regular basis.

Although the script is created for elementaryOS but it can be used in any other Ubuntu based distro's.

Before running the script do have a look at the script and remove/add the (unwanted/wanted) packages.
Run `install.sh` which will do the rest. This script requires `sudo` rights.

Once after installing the packages go through the things mentioned in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to complete the setup.
The installation script installs the packages. But few packages needs some manual/extra configuration to make use of them.
