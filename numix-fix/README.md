## Fix for Numix battery icon issue in elementaryOS

There is a long standing [issue](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme/issues/107) with Numix theme for the battery icons in elementaryOS Linux distro.

Seems like this issue is not going to be resolved soon.

So made a temporary fix to workaround this issue by renaming all battery related icons with another name and updating the Numix theme to use the default battery icons provided by elementaryOS.

Along with that an revert-back script is also provided to revert back this fix.
